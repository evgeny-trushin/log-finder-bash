## Quick Start

### Single Pattern Search
```bash
# Search for log files and log directories
./log-finder-bash.sh "*.log"
./log-finder-bash.sh "*logs*"
./log-finder-bash.sh "syslog*"

# Search for specific directory names
./log-finder-bash.sh "nginx"
./log-finder-bash.sh "apache*"
./log-finder-bash.sh "*config*"
```

### Batch Search (Multiple Patterns)
```bash
./log-finder-bash-batch.sh
```
Automatically searches for files and directories matching:
- `*.log` - Log files
- `*.log.*` - Rotated log files  
- `*logs*` - Log files and directories
- `syslog*` - System log files and directories
- `*.out` - Output files
- `*.err` - Error files
- `*.error` - Error log files
- `*debug*` - Debug files and directories
- `*trace*` - Trace files and directories

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/log-finder-bash.git
cd log-finder-bash
chmod +x *.sh
```
